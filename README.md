# IRC Client

Open the project @ "Source Code/JavaChatClient/" in [Netbeans IDE](https://netbeans.org/), compile it and run it. 

Alternatively, you can simply run the compiled IRC Client @ "Source Code/JavaChatClient/dist/JavaChatClient.jar".

# IRC Server

Open the project @ "Source Code/Java_IRCd/" in [Netbeans IDE](https://netbeans.org/), compile it and run it. 

Alternatively, you can simply run the compiled IRC Daemon @ "Source Code/Java_IRCd/dist/Java_IRCd.jar", although it is recommended to run it through the IDE so that you can easily terminate it, since it will run as a background service.

Test it using your favorite IRC Client.
